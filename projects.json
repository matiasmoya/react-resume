During two days we focused on the basic functionality to take pictures and display them on a map but especially on code quality which is the most optimal to make the app to feel fast like a native application. </p><p>We thought about an application that helps people to find their missing pets, in a social way. Users take pictures to pets in the streets with their phones, then this application will save it with geolocation data and tags, building a database of possible missing pets which the people who lost their pets can use it to find them.</p>",
