    "description": "<p>My team and I developed the back-end of this application using rails, and the front-end development with Ionic Framework for the rails rumble competition( www.railsrumble.com ). </p><p> The competition lasted 48 hours, very challenging! It was so much fun for me. During two days we focused on the basic functionality to take pictures and display them on a map but especially on code quality which is the most optimal to make the app to feel fast like a native application. </p><p>We thought about an application that helps people to find their missing pets, in a social way. Users take pictures to pets in the streets with their phones, then this application will save it with geolocation data and tags, building a database of possible missing pets which the people who lost their pets can use it to find them.</p>",
